Seismic QC Logging/Analysis. Written in C for compilation under MSDOS3.3+ (1990-92). Historical interest.

In the year 1990 I was working as a Marine Seismic Data Acquisition Consultant; my job - to represent the Oil Comany onboard the vessel and to ensure that contract specifications and targets were met.

Reflection Seismology depends on accurate acoustic source profiling (airguns) and multiple receiving hydrophone specifications.
At that time we still occasionally used sliderules but most likely small calculators such as the HP-41 and later.

Each survey line would have massive printouts which we'd manually run our eyes over and do a best calculation. Pencil and paper, labourious, prone to errors.

MY BRIGHT IDEA! Automate it!

It's the winter of 1989-1990 and I'm sitting in my cabin office on the latest modern GECO [Norway] seismic vessel and I'm the Shell [Norway] client rep onboard and a large part of my job is to monitor production quality, equipment spcifications, permitted failures and allowable deviations. Incredibly fucking boring and all done by hand, by inspecting the contractor qc printouts, flagging problems by inspection after the fact.

a year earlier I bought my first PC, a Compaq portable with one 5.25" floppy drive and 10MB HDD. Cost Â£3,300 and my wife freaked on me at the cost. First power-up and a gren blinking letter C:\ appears. I'm a hardware ngineer I remember. The only software I've ever played with is BASIC on a ZX Spectrum; read a lot of books, not a software dude at all!

At a port call in Doha a year later, still lugging my heavy Compay sewing machine all over the word with nothing to show for i, I wandered into a bookshop in the souk and found a book:

     "Understanding C" https://www.amazon.co.uk/Understanding-C-Bruce-H-Hunter/dp/0895881233
     
And so it began; seeing my interest the white-robed proprieor told me "You'll need these" and handed up a set of 5.25" floppy disks.

1.00  (1983)
	repackaged version of Lattice C
	two-pass compiler (MC1 and MC2)

	includes object module disassembler (OMD)

Wow! Back at sea the next day I wrote, compiled, linked and ran hello.c

A year passes, back to the North Sea in Winter; by this time I'm lugging a posh Toshiba 3100e and using Microsoft C Compiler V6 after an abortive foray into Clipper https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipper_(programming_language) via dBase II/III. Ouch.
