Seismic QC Logging/Analysis. Written in C for compilation under MSDOS3.3+ (1990-92). Historical interest.

In the year 1990 I was working as a Marine Seismic Data Acquisition Consultant; my job - to represent the Oil Comany onboard the vessel and to ensure that contract specifications and targets were met.

Reflection Seismology depends on accurate acoustic source profiling (airguns) and multiple receiving hydrophone specifications.
At that time we still occasionally used sliderules but most likely small calculators such as the HP-41 and later.

Each survey line would have massive printouts which we'd manually run our eyes over and do a best calculation. Pencil and paper, labourious, prone to errors.

MY BRIGHT IDEA! Automate it!
